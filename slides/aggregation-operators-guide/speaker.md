<!-- Slide 2: Complete Operator Coverage -->
**Scope Emphasis:** "This isn't just about $match, $group, and $sort. We're covering operators most developers have never used but that can solve complex problems elegantly."

**Show Slide List:** Briefly scroll through the operator categories to show the breadth.

---


<!-- Slide 3: Complete Operator Reference -->
**Organization Logic:** "I've organized these by impact and usage patterns. Core operators are your daily drivers, advanced operators solve specific problems."

**Learning Path:** "Start with core, then add advanced operators as your use cases demand them."

---


<!-- Slide 4: Architecture Deep Dive -->
**Visual Teaching:** Draw the pipeline flow on whiteboard if possible. "Each operator type affects memory and performance differently."
